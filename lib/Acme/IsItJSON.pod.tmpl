Not sure if your variable is a Perl data structure or a JSON string?

This Perl module can help.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 is_it_json

Given a variable containing something which you are not sure about,
and it may or may not be JSON or a Perl data structure, feed it to
this routine. This module uses support vector machines running on an
OCAML cluster backed up by a Node pipeline in an S3 cloud to
distinguish JSON from Perl data structures.

You can use Acme::IsItJSON under the same terms as Perl
itself. Alternatively, you can throw it in the fruit cellar where it
belongs.
